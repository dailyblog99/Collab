### Requirements

I have a website [placesinprague.com](https://placesinprague.com). It's a clone of a  theme from [Jekyll]().


Jekyll is a [ruby]() [gem](). What it basically does is that it allows static websites to run javascript.
Jekyll needs to be installed, which can get tricky but once its up and running it is very fast. 

- To download Jekyll click [here.]() 
    
-  To download Ruby click [here.]()



So, what I did was that I forked the theme and made some minor changes. Now I have reached a point where in 
I would like to add some functionality and change some appearances. 

Below are the points for which I would request your attention.

* Home Page
  
  The landing page is ok but I want to remove the link to the older posts and create three boxes with links to the posts.
  



* Multi-Lingual Support

  There is an existing repo that offers language support for Jekyll websites. The repo is located [here.]()
  The user is [WiredCraft.]() They make static websites for Fortune500 companies.
  
  The repo contains a bare theme  with Multilanguage support for English, French and Mandarin. I was wondering
  if you could include the same function for my site. I think the logic is written in `JS.`
